# RSA-simulation
JSONlab (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files-in-matlab-octave)
is required to run the simulation.

Run main_same_points.m for the same simulation as in the report.
Run main_different_points.m for an alternative simulation where the models work on different points instead of the same points.
